"# Portfolio" 
Welcome to my portfolio!

This is a work in progress, so please pardon the dust, but more will be coming soon!

Currently, there are three projects.

Two are previous class assignments and the last is a function written in VBA I created for Excel that (relatively) quickly finds the divisor sum (the sum of all whole number divisors) of a whole number.
