"# Portfolio" 
Welcome to my portfolio!

This is a work in progress, so please pardon the dust, but more will be coming soon!

At the moment there are three projects.

cnn_on_augmented_images.py was a class assignment for my Predictive Analytics class, written in Python. The goal of the assignment was to first inflate the size of a small dataset of images by augmenting them via random rotations, then to train a convolutional neural net on the augmented images, and check it's accuracy for classifying the images.

showcase_of_predictive_algorithms.Rmd was another Predictive Analytics assignment, this time written in R Markdown. For this assignment, the goal was to implement and compare various predictive algorithms on the same dataset of proteins. 

The last is a function written in VBA I created for Excel that (relatively) quickly finds the divisor sum (the sum of all whole number divisors) for a given whole number.

I am currently working on my fourth and final project to be added to this portfolio: a series of webcrawlers that will scrape dictionary data from a certain website, a pipeline to clean and modify the data to create a custom English Language Dictionary dataset, and then finally a program to use the dataset to create a custom word embedding. The goal of this embedding is for it to have the very nice property that, when vectorizing a newly created English word, it will be as simple as 1) appending a new column to all the other words, then 2) linearly combining the vectors of all the words that appear in the new word's definition.
