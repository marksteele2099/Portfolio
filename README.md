"# Portfolio" 
This is a portfolio of some of my programming work. I know it's sparse right now, but I hope to expand it in the future with more projects. I also plan to update and/or combine older projects to better reflect my current programming style and ability.

Currently, there are three projects.

Two are previous class assignments and the last is a function written in VBA I created for Excel that (relatively) quickly finds the divisor sum (the sum of all whole number divisors) of a whole number.
